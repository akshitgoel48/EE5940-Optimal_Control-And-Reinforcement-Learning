Thompson Sampling Approach for Two-Player Multi-Armed Bandits  
* Considered two-player repeated game in which each player’s reward drawn from unknown (fixed) distribution and
depends on both players’ actions.  
* Formulated the problem as two-player multi-armed bandit and tested a Thompson sampling approach with Gaussian
priors to learn desired policy.  
* Implemented the proposed approach in Julia using JuMP with GLPK optimizer for optimizing steps.
